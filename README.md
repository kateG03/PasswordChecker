# PasswordChecker
A security-based project for more experience in Python. 
Current version: 1.0 (8/4/2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------
My application creates password criteria for users based on three levels,
easy, normal & hard. Users will input a password of their creation of their
choosing and can play the game as many times as they want as the criteria
is randomized every time. 

I decided to write in Python to gain more experience, since my academic career
is focused mostly in Java and C/x86-64 Assembly. I also wanted to work on a project related
to security, since it has been my main focus since starting my job at Cybersecurity 4 You.

Issues I ran into were syntax-related since Python is not a main language of mine. Examples include
not needing semicolons or to declare types. I also had an issue with the built in functions like 
".isupper" or ".isnumeric" since that did not give me the intended boolean that I required for my checks.
I also had type mismatch issues which I mitigated with direct casting since I knew what the two types
needed to be.

No special running instructions.
